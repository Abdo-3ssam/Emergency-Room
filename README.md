### 2️⃣ Temporal Analysis (Arrival Patterns & Heatmaps)

Time-based analysis plays a major role in ER optimization.

- **Day & Time Heatmap**
  - Identifies **Thursday at 11:00 PM** as the highest patient influx period.
  - Highlights off-peak hours suitable for maintenance or training.

- **Weekly Trends**
  - Daily arrival fluctuations
  - Enables data-backed shift planning for doctors, nurses, and support staff
